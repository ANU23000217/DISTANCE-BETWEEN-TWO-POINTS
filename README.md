# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

import math
x1=4
y1 =2
x2=10
y2 = 6
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
print( "{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
